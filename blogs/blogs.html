                                        <p>The integration of AI in manufacturing processes has led to unprecedented levels of automation and intelligence. Machine learning algorithms can now predict equipment failures before they occur, allowing maintenance teams to address issues proactively rather than reactively.</p>
                                        <p>Computer vision systems inspect products with greater accuracy than human inspectors, identifying defects that might otherwise go unnoticed. This leads to higher quality products and fewer customer returns.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, AI-powered process optimization continuously analyzes production data to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, suggesting improvements that can lead to significant cost savings and productivity gains.</p>
